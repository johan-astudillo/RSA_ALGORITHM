# RSA_ALGORITHM
Algorithm RSA, get 2 any primes, get modular inverse, get co-primes

1. We generate a list of random primes from a specific range given by the user
 
2. Take two random prime numbers and take the composite
 
3. Generate Euler phi (prime -1) (prime2-1)

4. Generate a list of numbers before Euler phi
 
5. Get any coprime from the list
 
6. Find the inverse modulus of coprime and Euler_phi
 
7. Message to encrypt

8. Message to decrypt
